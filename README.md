**Get to your websites faster.**
Simply type "y", select the autocomplete "!yt" and the duckduckgo !bang for youtube is called.
Currently supported websites:
- youtube
- amazon.de
- reddit
- apple
- stackoverflow
- github
- soundcloud
- wolframalpha

This technically works with all available duckduckgo !bangs.
