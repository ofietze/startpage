Startpage
=======================

**Get to your websites faster.**
Simply type "y", select the autocomplete "!yt" and the duckduckgo !bang for youtube is called.
Currently supported websites in the dropdown:
- youtube
- amazon.de
- reddit
- apple
- stackoverflow
- github
- soundcloud
- wolframalpha

This works with all other available duckduckgo !bangs.


**New** time and calendar. See at a glance which day of the week/month it is.
**New** added hidden timer! To make sure your pasta is always al dente and your tea is just right.
Let's see if you find it. I see no point in giving any clues.

Oh, and there is more. You get a random encouragement, insult or other message at the start.
